= Best practices for converting documents to Metanorma

This document describes some best practices to bear in mind
when converting documents from any format to Metanorma AsciiDoc files.


== Content in general

* Always remove trailing whitespaces in the converted document.

* Always replace long dashes (—) with their AsciiDoc markup equivalent (`--`).

* Same case for single and double quotes:

** Single quotes:
+
----
‘text’ -> '`text`'
----

** Double quotes:
+
----
“text” -> "`text`"
----

* Always keep lines at no more than 80 characters wide for readability.


== Tables

* Tables should not include width attributes. The width in a table is
automatically laid out by Metanorma.

* In table body cells, split the content of the cell if it surpasses 80
characters.

* In table header cells, try to keep all the cells in one line unless they
get too long (over 80 characters).

* In table column attributes, always use `a` column style operator to support
block elements inside the table, e.g. `[cols="a,2a"]` over `[cols="1,2"]`.


== Bibliography and references

* When composing bibliographic references, do not let any blank space
between the comma (that lies after the anchor) and the reference identifier.
I.e.:
+
--
Instead of this:
----
* [[[ogc20-010, OGC 20-010]]]
----

Do this:
----
* [[[ogc20-010,OGC 20-010]]]
----
--
