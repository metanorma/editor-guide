= Metanorma Editor's Guide

== Scope

Best practices for editing Metanorma documents.


== Images

=== Always use lowercase image filenames

If you:

. have a file named `image.PNG`
. use this line to include it `image::image.png[]`

This will work on macOS and Windows, but will fail on Linux!

Linux uses case-sensitive file systems i.e. `image.PNG` and `image.png` are different file names
and Metanorma will fail to find the specified `image.png`.


== Math


=== LaTeX math

Do not use the `eqnarray` environment since it is not supported by `latexmlmath`.

If you want to know if an equation will pass, try this:

`math.lxml`
[source,latex]
----
V = \frac{1}{2} \: {\bf u}^t \:
            \int_{surface} \: {B'}^t \: D' \: B' \: ds
               \; {\bf u}
----

Run:

[source,sh]
----
cat math.lxml | latexmlmath -
----
